        <h2>Why freelancers need project management tools</h2>
        <p>
            As a freelancer, you’re not just doing the work—you’re also managing clients, 
            deadlines, invoices, and communication. A good project management tool helps you 
            keep everything in one place so nothing slips through the cracks.
        </p>

            Notion is perfect if you want a customizable system. You can build task boards, 
            client dashboards, content calendars, and more using databases and templates.

        <h2>How to choose the right project management tool</h2>
        <p>
            Ask yourself:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do I prefer simple boards or detailed structures?</li>
            <li>Do I need time tracking and reporting?</li>
            <li>Do I collaborate with teams or mostly work solo?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Start with one tool, use it for a month, and refine your setup as you go.

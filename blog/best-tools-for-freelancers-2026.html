        <h2>How to choose the right tools for your freelance business</h2>
        <p>
            You don’t need every tool on this list. Start with your biggest bottleneck:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you feel disorganized → start with Notion or ClickUp.</li>
            <li>If your visuals are weak → start with Canva or Figma.</li>
            <li>If writing slows you down → start with Grammarly.</li>
            <li>If you waste time on manual tasks → start with Zapier and Airtable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As your business grows, you can layer tools strategically instead of adding them randomly.
        </p>
